=========================================
Work on open source projects like this is not possible without funding. The amount of time it takes to update the codebases, create examples, tutorials and more is quite expensive. Please consider either a one-time or monthly donation to keep this engine going and more frequently updated. 

We have a [Patron Page](https://www.patreon.com/pawbyte?ty=h) that you can help fund future open source projects and the updates to this one.

There is also a [PayPal](http://gamepencil.pawbyte.com/donate/) one time donation method as well. 

I appreciate your generousity and moving this project forward.
